# SFM Slim
SFM Slim is the slimmest FAP20-certified optical fingerprint module featuring an array of cutting-edge technologies.
Along with its 13.5mm-slim optical sensor and Suprema’s Conformance Decision Engine (CDE) technology that captures an optimal fingerprint image for all the finger types, SFM Slim offers you flexibility to create a new and innovative system design with its reduced form factor at a whole new level of performance that will distinguish you from your competitors.
Powered by a state-of-the-art 1GHz CPU, MINEX-certified algorithm and 256-bit AES fingerprint data encryption, SFM Slim also features best-in-class performance (5,000 match/ sec) and FBI PIV-compliance with the highest level security.
