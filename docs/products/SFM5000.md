# SFM5000 Series 
SFM5000 is the latest UniFinger module equipped with
world’s leading fingerprint authentication algorithm, which
ranked No. 1 in FVC2004, 2006 and ongoing. The SFM5000
series features powerful 533MHz DSP which optimized
for performance while minimizing power consumption

## Features
- Powerful 533MHz DSP
- 1:1 verification in 600ms
- Fast Power-on Time
- 8 configurable Digital I/O Ports
- 1:1,000 Identification in 760ms
- Suprema, ISO 19794-2 and ANSI 378 Template Options
- 256-bit AES Fingerprint Data Encryption
- 4MB Flash Memory Option  

> **Hybrid Live Finger Detection Technology**  
> Suprema’s LFD technology is based on comparison of dynamic and static image characteristics of the fake fingers to live fingers. By the advanced analysis algorithm to detect the abnormalities in dynamic changing pattern of fingerprint images, and several static features showing liveliness or unnaturalness of fingers, fake fingers are clearly distinguished from the live fingers. This new LFD technology provides efficient and effective solution to protect the fingerprint system from attack via fake fingerprints.
